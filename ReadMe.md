## Deep Learning - Face Generator

In this repository, I am going to generate realistic looking faces with Machine Learning. In order to do so, we are going to leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and more specifically Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs). By the end of this post, you will be able to successfully train a GAN to sample an infinite amount of images based on a given dataset, which in our case will be human faces.
